- Create a package called userProgram and put Roma in it


Changes:
- removed addCardToHand (it was no longer in the interface)
- copied EpochNew.java from TestSuite17-5.jar 
	- (it is assumed that this is the only change between that jar and 
	collectionOfTests.jar
	   
- removed testOnager -  test is WRONG "game.rigBattleDie(9000)"
